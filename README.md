The paradox of technology is it can simultaneously enable human flourishing at the highest levels while also producing negative externalities that reduce individual human happiness. Our purpose at [The Ethical Tech Project](https://www.ethicaltechproject.com/) is to achieve an efficient frontier for the coexistence of practical technologies along with our fundamental rights as human beings - ultimately diminishing or eliminating these negative externalities and maximizing the surplus of human happiness. We label this type of technology that submits or is subservient to humanity as “ethical.”

Privacy in the modern era has been an ethical conception since Justice Louis Brandeis declared ‘[The Right to Privacy.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1321160?refreqid=excelsior%3A0e7c445047026a2f7f18fc69652a3d89&seq=1)’  Almost 150 years since Justice Brandeis argued this implicitly longstanding right as akin to "the common law [that] has always recognized a man's house as his castle, impregnable," the perversion of the right to privacy has only gotten more acute. The incessant development of technology has enabled mass data collection and the increasing complexity of technology has made it difficult to prevent [violations of privacy rights](https://www.ethicaltechproject.com/privacy). The need for technologists to come together and agree to a comprehensive system for enforcing privacy rights and bringing balance to humanity’s prerogative to benefit from technology has never been more clear.

The Ethical Tech Project has convened a group of experts across academia, business, and government to create a flexible and scalable set of Privacy Standards that places data owners - humans - at the core of technology that consumes data and finally offer an alternative to the rampant disregard for the right to privacy. We aim for Privacy Standards that, with each new adoptee, build a data supply chain with privacy-by-design and permission at its core aligned to the principles of Data Dignity and Data Control.

## Problem
Empower technologists to architect, design, build and maintain systems that respect privacy by design and process data ethically. The right solution is the one that can be implemented once and withstand the changing regulatory compliance landscape. By clearly articulating the tradeoffs such a solution supports both securing the data and extracting value from the data. With the right set of controls in place every stakeholder can act independently to orchestrate an organization’s posture towards privacy compliance.

## Discussions
Debate pertaining to privacy stack features takes place in the form of [Discussions](https://github.com/ethical-tech-project/the-privacy-stack/discussions) in this repo.

If you want to suggest a feature, discuss current design notes or proposals, etc., please [open a new Discussion topic](https://github.com/ethical-tech-project/the-privacy-stack/discussions/new).

Discussions that are short and stay on topic are much more likely to be read. If you leave comment number fifty, chances are that only a few people will read it. To make discussions easier to navigate and benefit from, please observe a few rules of thumb:

- Discussion should be relevant to the Privacy Stack design. If they are not, they will be summarily closed.
- Choose a descriptive topic that clearly communicates the scope of discussion.
- Stick to the topic of the discussion. If a comment is tangential, or goes into detail on a subtopic, start a new discussion and link back.
- Is your comment useful for others to read, or can it be adequately expressed with an emoji reaction to an existing comment?

## Design Process
[Proposals](proposals) evolve as a result of decisions in [Privacy Stack Design Meetings](meetings), which are informed by [discussions](https://github.com/ethical-tech-project/the-privacy-stack/discussions).

**DISCLAIMER**: An active proposal is under active consideration for inclusion into a future version of the Privacy Stack Reference Architecture but is not in any way guaranteed to ultimately be included in the next or any version of the architecture. A proposal may be postponed or rejected at any time during any phase of the above process based on feedback from the design team, or community.

## Privacy Stack Design Meetings
Privacy Stack Design Meetings (PSDMs) are held by the Privacy Stack Design Team and occasional invited guests, and are documented in Design Meeting Notes in the meetings folder, organized in folders by year. The lifetime of a design meeting note is described in meetings/README.md. PSDMs are where decisions about future C# versions are made, including which proposals to work on, how to evolve the proposals, and whether and when to adopt them.

## Implementation

The reference implementation of the privacy stack is coming soon.
